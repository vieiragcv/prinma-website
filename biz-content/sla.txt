A service-level agreement includes key components and details of the service to be provided. 
As such, it is usually crafted by the service provider. 
Customers, when meeting with vendors, state their requirements and include them in request for proposal (RFP) documents. 
But as an agreement document, either customer or service provider can craft the SLA.

An SLA has two important areas: 

  Services: 
  
    List of services provided
    List of services excluded
    Service availability
    Condition of level of service (or different levels for multiple services)
    Duties and responsibilities of each party
    Response time
    Escalation procedures
    Resolution time
    Service credits, in case the provider fails to provide the agreed level of service
  
  Management:

    Measurement standards and methods
    Reporting process
    Conflict resolution process
    Indemnification clause
    Other exclusions due to unforeseen events
